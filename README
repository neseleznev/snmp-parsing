This is not a example of good parsing style (error reporting is especially
bad), but this is not a compiler course, and it should be enough to get you
started.

Note that you can achieve the same results with just StreamTokenizer or
Scanner, but it is cleaner and not much longer to do it with JFlex and CUP.
