This repository provides
snmp4j https://www.snmp4j.org/
and
cup http://www2.cs.tum.edu/projects/cup/
libraries, you need only

1) Install JFlex http://jflex.de/installing.html

2) make all
or make all_a if you don't want to recompile Parser & Lexer

This is not a example of good parsing style (error reporting is especially
bad), but this is not a compiler course, and it should be enough to get you
started.

Note that you can achieve the same results with just StreamTokenizer or
Scanner, but it is cleaner and not much longer to do it with JFlex and CUP.

===============================

Some information about classes. Let's go as-is, driven by workflow in Grabber,
the main class (under development).

1) Parser, Lexer, Sym -- classes, generated by Cup and JFlex, respectively.

2) Contents of .cfg file become an instance of helper class ConfigFile,
which stores two List<SnmpAgent> -- one for switches, another for routers.
Both could be initialized with or without credentials, v1, v2c, v3 as well.

3) We create only one connection for all requests, TransportMapping and Snmp objects,
then we reuse them to retrieve all required data.

4) Instantiate Switch and Router objects from appropriate lists, invoke discover()
method and print result on standart output.

5) Switch contains a field for Vlans, which are simple data structure, used to
represent grabbed data. The same about classes Iface and Route, when Router is
asked about interfaces and routes.

Also there are helper classes: SnmpConstants, Utils
